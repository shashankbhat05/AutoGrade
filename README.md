# AutoGrade - Automated Grading System

AutoGrade is an intelligent, automated grading system designed to streamline the evaluation process in educational institutions. The system uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** technologies to process scanned answer scripts and PDF documents, automating the grading of student responses.

## Features
- **OCR and NLP Integration**: Automatically extracts text from scanned answer sheets and PDFs for evaluation.
- **BERT-based Answer Evaluation**: Uses a pretrained BERT model to compare student responses with model answers for accurate, context-aware grading.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web app that allows teachers to upload exam data (question papers, model answers), track evaluations, and generate reports.
- **Automated Result Generation**: Generates detailed results with performance analytics such as pass/fail distributions and insights into student performance.
- **Firebase Database**: Uses Firebase for secure and efficient data storage.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time and effort needed for manual grading, enabling faster feedback.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in the grading process.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of student responses seamlessly.
  
## Installation
To run the AutoGrade system locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashankbhat05/AutoGrade.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Firebase and update the credentials in the configuration file.
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend processing
- **Flask** for web application
- **Firebase** for data storage
